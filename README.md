# WorkDaySchedular

I have created and work day schedular that allows you
to  input task hourly. Once it is the current hour with the corresponding time block it will light up red, anything in the future is green and in the past is a light grey. The saved task is saved locally, so you can close or refresh your browser and your informations is not losted.
